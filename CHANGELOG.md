### GOLD Push - Cleaned everything 
 - After losing some changes made in previous versions due to a computer failure, this update is the start to something new. 
 - Cleaned up the README file to reflect everything right.
 - ENHANCED the theme choosing and selecting - instead of putting the theme name in the settings.inc.php, it's controlled on the DB settings table. There is also a .enabled file created to check if the theme is enabled.

### Original Push
